*   **Firestore Database**: Store user data, exam results, and progress in a NoSQL database
*   **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 integration to track user engagement and performance metrics

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
*   **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
*   **Database**: Firestore
*   **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4
*   **Deployment**: Netlify

## Project Structure

The project is structured as a typical Vite + React application.

**Note**: The `/src` directory contains the core application logic and should be created according to the structure above.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or higher)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually included with Node.js)
*   A [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) account
*   A [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) account

### Local Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Firebase**:

    *   Follow the detailed instructions in the `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` file to create a Firebase project, enable authentication (Google & GitHub), and set up Firestore.
    *   Create a `firebase.ts` file in the `src/config/` directory.
    *   Add your Firebase configuration to this file:

        ```typescript
        // src/config/firebase.ts
        import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
        import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
        import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

        const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
          messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
          appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
          measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
        };

        const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
        export const auth = getAuth(app);
        export const db = getFirestore(app);

        export default app;
        ```

4.  **Configure Google Analytics**:

    *   Follow the instructions in `ANALYTICS_SETUP.md` to create a Google Analytics 4 property.
    *   Create an `analytics.ts` file in the `src/utils/` directory.
    *   Add your measurement ID to this file:

        ```typescript
        // src/utils/analytics.ts
        import ReactGA from 'react-ga4';

        const GA_MEASUREMENT_ID = 'G-XXXXXXXXXX'; // Replace with your measurement ID

        export const initGA = () => {
          ReactGA.initialize(GA_MEASUREMENT_ID);
        };

        export const logPageView = () => {
          ReactGA.send({ hitType: 'pageview', page: window.location.pathname });
        };

        export const logEvent = (category: string, action: string, label?: string) => {
          ReactGA.event({
            category,
            action,
            label,
          });
        };
        ```

5.  **Run the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port indicated by Vite).

## Available Scripts

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server with hot module replacement
*   `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript application and builds it for production in the `dist` directory
*   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview

## Deployment

This project is pre-configured for easy deployment on Netlify. The `netlify.toml` file contains the necessary build settings.

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository
2.  Connect your repository to Netlify
3.  Configure environment variables for your Firebase and Google Analytics configuration keys in the Netlify site settings
4.  Trigger a deployment. Netlify will automatically run the `npm run build` command and deploy the contents of the `dist` directory
